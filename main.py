# Background

Where did these notes come from? See the [README](README.md).

# Learning Tips 

- [Learning How To Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course on Coursera is amazing and very useful. Take the full course, or read this [summary](https://medium.com/learn-love-code/learnings-from-learning-how-to-learn-19d149920dc4) on Medium.

- **Track concepts - "To learn", "Revising", "Done"**
	- Any terms I couldn't easily explain went on to post-its. 
	- One term per post-it. 
	- "To learn", "Revising", "Done" was written on my whiteboard and I moved my post-its between these categories, I attended to this every few days.
	- I looked up terms everyday, and I practiced recalling terms and explaining them to myself every time I remembered I had these interviews coming up (frequently).
	- I focused on the most difficult topics first before moving onto easier topics.
	- I carried around a notebook and wrote down terms and explanations. 
	- Using paper reduces distractions.

- **How to review concepts**
	- Use spaced-repetition.
	- Don't immediately look up the answer, EVEN IF you have never seen the term before. Ask yourself what the term means. Guess the answer. Then look it up.
	- Review terms *all the time*. You can review items in your head at any time. If I was struggling to fall asleep, I'd go through terms in my head and explained them to myself. 100% success rate of falling asleep in less than 10 minutes, works every time. 

- **Target your learning**
	- Think *hard* about what specific team you are going for, what skills do they want? If you aren't sure, then ask someone who will definitely know.
	- Always focus on the areas you struggle with the most *first* in a study session. Then move on to easier or more familiar topics. 

- **Identify what you need to work on** 
	- Spend more time doing the difficult things.
	- If you're weak on coding and you find yourself avoiding it, then spend most of your study time doing that.

- **Read**
	- Read relevant books (you don't have to read back to back).
	- When looking up things online, avoid going more than two referral links deep - this will save you from browser tab hell.

- **Mental health**
	- Take care of your basic needs first - sleep, eat well, drink water, gentle exercise. You know yourself, so do what's best for you.
	- You are more than your economic output, remember to separate your self worth from your paycheque. 
	- See interviews for what they are - they are *not* a measure of you being "good enough".


# Interviewing Tips 

- **Interview questions**
	- Interview questions are intentionally vague. This is to encourage questions.
	- Ask clarifying questions 
	- Questions reveal how you approach problems.
	- Write down notes about the question. This is so you don't forget details and only partially answer, or give the wrong answer.
	- Interviews should be more like a conversation with a lot of back and forth, thoroughly explore scenarios together and avoid jumping too fast to a solution.
	- The interviewer can only make an evaluation on your suitability for the job based on the things you *say*. 
	- **Interviewers test depth of knowledge**
		- There will be questions about technical details on topics to the point where it'll be hard to answer. This is okay, try your best to work through it and say what you're thinking.
		- Interviewers often aren't looking for specific answers, they just want to see how deeply you know a topic.
		- Approach the question from a low level and even ask your interviewer if you need to add more details before moving on.
	- **Interviewers test breadth of knowledge**
		- There will be questions related to the role you're applying for and some that aren't. This is to explore breadth of knowledge. 
		- Try your best to explore the scenarios and ask questions. It's very important to say your thinking aloud, you might be on the right track.

- **Show comprehension**
	- Try to always ask clarifying questions even if you think you already know the answer. You might learn some nuance that even improves your idea.
	- Always repeat the question back to the interviewer to both check your understanding and give yourself thinking time.
	- *"Okay, I'll repeat back the question so I can check my understanding…"*
	- *"Just to clarify…"*
	- *"I just want to check I heard correctly…"*
	
- **State your assumptions**
	- Your interviewer will provide feedback if your assumptions are unreasonable.
	- *"I am going to assume that the organisation is collecting x,y,z logs from hosts and storing these for at least 90 days…"* 
	- *"Can I make the assumption that…?"*
	- *"Let's say that we can get x,y,z information…"*

- **When asked a question you're not sure of the answer to right away, try these phrases:**
	- *"I don't know but if I had to invent it, it would be like this…"*
	- *"I don't know that exactly but I know something about a similar subject / sub component…"*
	- *"This is what's popping into my mind right now is…"*
	- *"The only thing that is coming to mind is…"* 
	- *"I know a lot about [similar thing], I could talk about that instead? Would that be okay?"*

- **Say what you are thinking**
	- The interviewer can only make an evaluation on your suitability for the job based on the things you *say*. 
	- If you don't say your thought process aloud, then the interviewer doesn't know what you know. 
	- You may well be on the right track with an answer. You'll be kicking yourself afterwards if you later realise you were but didn't say anything (I missed out on an internship because of this!).
	- Write pseudo code for your coding solution so you don't have to hold everything in your head.
	- *"Right now I am thinking about…"*
	- *"I am thinking about different approaches, for example…"*
	- *"I keep coming back to [subject/idea/thing] but I think that's not the right direction. I am thinking about…"*
	- *"I'm interested in this idea that…"*

- **Reduce cognitive load**
	- Take notes on the question and assumptions during the interview.
	- If the infrastructure is complicated, draw up what you think it looks like. 
	- Write pseudocode. 
	- Write tests and expected output for code you write, test your code against it. 

- **Prepare**
	- Make a checklist that reminds you of what to do for each question, something like:
		- Listen to interview question
		- Take notes on the question
		- Repeat the question
		- Ask clarifying questions
		- State any assumptions
	- Prepare questions that you want to ask your interviewers at the end of the interview so you don't need to think of them on the spot on the day. Since an interview is also for you to know more about the workplace, I asked questions about the worst parts of the job. 
	- Bring some small snacks in a box or container that isn't noisy and distracting. A little bit of sugar throughout the interviews can help your problem solving abilities. 
	- Stay hydrated - and take a toilet break between every interview if you need to (it's good to take a quiet moment).

- **Do practice interviews**
	- Do them until they feel more comfortable and you can easily talk through problems.
	- Ask your friends/peers to give you really hard questions that you definitely don't know how to answer.
	- Practice being in the very uncomfortable position where you have no idea about the topic you've been asked. Work through it from first principles.
	- Practice speaking aloud everything you know about a topic, even details you think might be irrelevant. 
	- Doooo theeeeemmm yes they can be annoying to organise but it is *worth it*.

### Interviewers are potential friends and they want to help you get the job, they are on your side. Let them help you, ask them questions, recite everything you know on a topic and *say your thought process out loud*.


# Networking 

- OSI Model
	- Application; layer 7 (and basically layers 5 & 6) (includes API, HTTP, etc).
	- Transport; layer 4 (TCP/UDP).
	- Network; layer 3 (Routing).
	- Datalink; layer 2 (Error checking and frame synchronisation).
	- Physical; layer 1 (Bits over fibre).	
- Firewalls
	- Rules to prevent incoming and outgoing connections.	
- NAT 
	- Useful to understand IPv4 vs IPv6.
- DNS
	- (53)
	- Requests to DNS are usually UDP, unless the server gives a redirect notice asking for a TCP connection. Look up in cache happens first. DNS exfiltration. Using raw IP addresses means no DNS logs, but there are HTTP logs. DNS sinkholes.
	- In a reverse DNS lookup, PTR might contain- 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa, which will map to  208.80.152.2. DNS lookups start at the end of the string and work backwards, which is why the IP address is backwards in PTR.
- DNS exfiltration 
	- Sending data as subdomains. 
	- 26856485f6476a567567c6576e678.badguy.com
	- Doesn’t show up in http logs. 
- DNS configs
	- Start of Authority (SOA).
	- IP addresses (A and AAAA).

- Multiplex 
	- Timeshare, statistical share, just useful to know it exists.
- Traceroute 
	- Usually uses UDP, but might also use ICMP Echo Request or TCP SYN. TTL, or hop-limit.
	- Initial hop-limit is 128 for windows and 64 for *nix. Destination returns ICMP Echo Reply. 
- Nmap 
	- Network scanning tool.
- Intercepts (PitM - Person in the middle)
	- Understand PKI (public key infrastructure in relation to this).
- VPN 
	- Hide traffic from ISP but expose traffic to VPN provider.
- Tor 
	- Traffic is obvious on a network. 
	- How do organised crime investigators find people on tor networks. 
- Proxy  
	- Why 7 proxies won’t help you. 
- BGP
	- Border Gateway Protocol.
	- Holds the internet together.
- Network traffic tools
	- Wireshark
	- Tcpdump
	- Burp suite
- HTTP/S 
	- (80, 443)
- SSL/TLS
	- (443) 
	- Super important to learn this, includes learning about handshakes, encryption, signing, certificate authorities, trust systems. A good [primer](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2021/january/19/it-security-guidelines-for-transport-layer-security-2.1) on all these concepts and algorithms is made available by the Dutch cybersecurity center.
	- POODLE, BEAST, CRIME, BREACH, HEARTBLEED.
- TCP/UDP
	- Web traffic, chat, voip, traceroute.
	- TCP will throttle back if packets are lost but UDP doesn't. 
	- Streaming can slow network TCP connections sharing the same network.
- ICMP 
	- Ping and traceroute.
- Mail
	- SMTP (25, 587, 465)
	- IMAP (143, 993)
	- POP3 (110, 995)
- SSH 
	- (22)
	- Handshake uses asymmetric encryption to exchange symmetric key.
- Telnet
	- (23, 992)
	- Allows remote communication with hosts.
- ARP  
	- Who is 0.0.0.0? Tell 0.0.0.1.
	- Linking IP address to MAC, Looks at cache first.
- DHCP 
	- (67, 68) (546, 547)
	- Dynamic (leases IP address, not persistent).
	- Automatic (leases IP address and remembers MAC and IP pairing in a table).
	- Manual (static IP set by administrator).
- IRC 
	- Understand use by hackers (botnets).

# Web Application 

- Same origin policy
	- Only accept requests from the same origin domain.  
- CORS 
	- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Can specify allowed origins in HTTP headers. Sends a preflight request with options set asking if the server approves, and if the server approves, then the actual request is sent (eg. should client send auth cookies).

	- Miners, cred stealers, adware.
- Local file inclusion
- Remote file inclusion (not as common these days)
- SSRF 
	- Server Side Request Forgery.
- Web vuln scanners. 
- SQLmap.
- Malicious redirects.


# Infrastructure (Prod / Cloud) Virtualisation 

- Hypervisors.
- Hyperjacking.
- Containers, VMs, clusters.
- Escaping techniques.
	- Network connections from VMs / containers.  
- Lateral movement and privilege escalation techniques.
	- Cloud Service Accounts can be used for lateral movement and privilege escalation in Cloud environments.
	- GCPloit tool for Google Cloud Projects.
- Site isolation.
- Side-channel attacks.
	- Spectre, Meltdown.
- Beyondcorp 
	- Trusting the host but not the network.

# OS Implementation and Systems

- Privilege escalation techniques, and prevention.
- Buffer Overflows.
- Directory traversal (prevention).
- Remote Code Execution / getting shells.
- Local databases
	- Some messaging apps use sqlite for storing messages.
	- Useful for digital forensics, especially on phones.
- Windows
	- Windows registry and group policy.
	- Active Directory (AD).
		- Bloodhound tool. 
		- Kerberos authentication with AD.
	- Windows SMB. 
	- Samba (with SMB).
	- Buffer Overflows. 
	- ROP. 
	
- *nix 
	- SELinux.
	- Kernel, userspace, permissions.
	- MAC vs DAC.
	- /proc
	- /tmp - code can be saved here and executed.
	- /shadow 
	- LDAP - Lightweight Directory Browsing Protocol. Lets users have one password for many services. This is similar to Active Directory in windows.
- MacOS
	- Gotofail error (SSL).
	- MacSweeper.
	- Research Mac vulnerabilities.

## Mitigations 
- Patching 
- Data Execution Prevention
- Address space layout randomisation
	- To make it harder for buffer overruns to execute privileged instructions at known addresses in memory.
- Principle of least privilege
	- Eg running Internet Explorer with the Administrator SID disabled in the process token. Reduces the ability of buffer overrun exploits to run as elevated user.
- Code signing
	- Requiring kernel mode code to be digitally signed.
- Compiler security features
	- Use of compilers that trap buffer overruns.
- Encryption
	- Of software and/or firmware components.
- Mandatory Access Controls
	- (MACs)
	- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
	- Operating systems with Mandatory Access Controls - eg. SELinux.
- "Insecure by exception"
	- When to allow people to do certain things for their job, and how to improve everything else. Don't try to "fix" security, just improve it by 99%.
- Do not blame the user
	- Security is about protecting people, we should build technology that people can trust, not constantly blame users. 


# Cryptography, Authentication, Identity 

- Encryption vs Encoding vs Hashing vs Obfuscation vs Signing
	- Be able to explain the differences between these things. 
	- [Various attack models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_model) (e.g. chosen-plaintext attack).

- Encryption standards + implementations
	- [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) (asymmetrical).
	- [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (symmetrical).
	- [ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) (namely ed25519) (asymmetric).
	- [Chacha/Salsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant) (symmetric).

- Asymmetric vs symmetric
	- Asymmetric is slow, but good for establishing a trusted connection.
	- Symmetric has a shared key and is faster. Protocols often use asymmetric to transfer symmetric key.
	- Perfect forward secrecy - eg Signal uses this.

- Cyphers
	- Block vs stream [ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher).
	- [Block cipher modes of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation).
	- [AES-GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode).

- Integrity and authenticity primitives
	- [Hashing functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) e.g. MD5, Sha-1, BLAKE. Used for identifiers, very useful for fingerprinting malware samples.
	- [Message Authentication Codes (MACs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code).
	- [Keyed-hash MAC (HMAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC).

- Entropy
	- PRNG (pseudo random number generators).
	- Entropy buffer draining.
	- Methods of filling entropy buffer.

- Authentication
	- Certificates 
		- What info do certs contain, how are they signed? 
		- Look at DigiNotar.
	- Trusted Platform Module 
		- (TPM)
		- Trusted storage for certs and auth data locally on device/host.
	- O-auth
		- Bearer tokens, this can be stolen and used, just like cookies.
	- Auth Cookies
		- Client side.
	- Sessions 
		- Server side.
	- Auth systems 
		- SAMLv2o.
		- OpenID.
		- Kerberos. 
			- Gold & silver tickets.
			- Mimikatz.
			- Pass-the-hash.	  
	- Biometrics
		- Can't rotate unlike passwords.
	- Password management
		- Rotating passwords (and why this is bad). 
		- Different password lockers. 
	- U2F / FIDO
		- Eg. Yubikeys.
		- Helps prevent successful phishing of credentials.
	- Compare and contrast multi-factor auth methods.

- Identity
	- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
		- Control which authenicated users can access which resources.
	- Service accounts vs User accounts
		- Robot accounts or Service accounts are used for automation.
		- Service accounts should have heavily restricted priviledges.
		- Understanding how Service accounts are used by attackers is important for understanding Cloud security.  
	- impersonation
		- Exported account keys.
		- ActAs, JWT (JSON Web Token) in Cloud.
	- Federated identity
